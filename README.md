This is my version of the game "Don't Find The Fox" that you can check out and play [here](https://denizsoyhan.github.io/don-tFindTheFox/).

# 1) How the game works:
>* Every day you have a deck consisting of 16 cards. 5 cards will have '**F**', 6 cards will have '**O**' and 5 cards will have the letter '**X**' on the back.
>* Every single day a random seed will be generated. Using this random seed, the deck will be shuffled and random blocks of the board will be revealed. 
>* You need to fill the board using the cards and simply **Don't Find The Fox**.

# 2) Power Ups:
You might be thinking to yourself: '*Wow isn't this just a coin toss then*'. You might have been right if you didn't have awesome power ups at your disposel.
## Reveal A Card:
You can reveal a card in your hand so you can place the card in the best spot possible.

## Feel Your Cards:
With this power up you can learn what your hand consists of so you can make a better decision on what to do next.

# 3) Randomization:
I used pseudo-random seed generation via the current date. So every one plays the same hand and the board on the same day. It defaults to current day based on the JS time server. I wanted it to be like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
So you and your friend can say "Have you find the fox today?" hopefully :P<br>
